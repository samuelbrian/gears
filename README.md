# Gears!

8, 10, 16, 20, 30, 32, 40, 50, 60, 64, 70, 80, 90, 100, and 200 tooth involute spur gear profiles with Diametral Pitch of 6 and Pressure Angle of 20. And a rack gear.

SVGs generated by [geargenerator.com](http://geargenerator.com). 
These were converted to DXF with Inkscape and cleaned up for use in CAD.

The gear profiles should all mate -- just scale as desired.
